# AD/AE Appendices Track

The chair of this track works with the Reproducibility Chair, and the Technical Papers Chairs to implement the necessary workflows for the submission of **Artifact Description** and **Artifact Evaluation Appendices** with the papers.

In SC19, Artifact Description (AD) appendices were for the first time made mandatory for all technical papers. 

The AD/AE Appendices Committee works, under the direction of its track chair, to conduct the review of all appendices submitted with technical papers. 
**The review of appendices is a double-open process**, where committee members contact authors directly to help improve the appendices.

## SC19 summary of the reviews

- Out of a total 338 submissions, 96 were rejected before response leaving 242 appendices requiring review. 
- 139 of those 242 appendices were determined to be complete, 87 incomplete, and 16 were missing.  
- The review initiated more than a hundred email threads resulting in updates to nearly all the incomplete appendices.  
- Of the 16 papers with missing appendices, 11 appendices were added and judged complete, 3 papers were determined to not require an appendix as they were pure theory papers, and 2 papers were rejected after they elected not to provide the mandatory AD appendix, even after being warned of that outcome.  
- 8 candidates for Best Student Paper and 6 candidates for Best Paper had incomplete appendices before the review; one candidate for Best Student Paper did not have the mandatory AD appendix before the review (and therefore was set to be rejected) but the review process helped the authors provide the complete appendix and stay in the running for BSP.
