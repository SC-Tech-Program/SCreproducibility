## AA Badge Eligibility

For eligibility: 
- at lease one of Q1, Q2, Q3 shour de answered with the first option

Ineligible if:
- any question answered with the middle option
- Q4 answered with option 3

Final review of eligibility:
- Even if authors self-report eligibility with the right responses to these questions, the **AD/AE Appendices Committee*
needs to do a final review, following URLs and checking that artifacts are deposited in a _permanent archive_ with a _unique identifier_.

### Note:
Many authors still are unclear that a link to the public software repository used for development under version control _is not sufficient_.
(Owners can delete a software repository at any time.)
A permanent archival-quality deposit must be made with a service that provides a global identifier (such as a DOI) and is persistent.
