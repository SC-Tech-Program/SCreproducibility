# Journal Special Issue Track

This committee reviews full papers submitted by the teams of _last year's conference_ Student Cluster Competition SCC, reporting on their reproducibility challenge. 
Note that the reproducibility challenge corresponds to a benchmark constructed from the previous conference to the SCC, so the papers reviewed by this committee reports on attempts to reproduce results presented at SC _two years prior_ to the current cycle.

The papers will appear in a Parallel Computing (PARCO) Special Issue.

Teams are _invited_ to submit an extended paper after the conference they participated on is concluded.
In the SC19 cycle, the 9 top-scoring teams from the SC18 SCC were invited to submit extended papers.
