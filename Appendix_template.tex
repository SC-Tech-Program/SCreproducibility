\section*{Artifact Availability}

\paragraph{Software Artifact Availability:}  (One of these options remains.)

--- All author-created software artifacts are maintained in a public repository under an OSI- approved license.

---Some author-created software artifacts are NOT maintained in a public repository or are NOT available under an OSI-approved license.

---There are no author-created software artifacts.

\paragraph{Hardware Artifact Availability:}  (One of these options remains.)

--- All author-created hardware artifacts are available and comply with the Open Source Hardware Definition.
--- Some author-created hardware artifacts are NOT available or do NOT comply with the Open Source Hardware Definition.
---There are no author-created hardware artifacts.

\paragraph{Data Artifact Availability: }  (One of these options remains.)

--- All author-created data artifacts are maintained in a public repository with a stable identifier, such as a DOI.

--- Some author-created data artifacts are NOT maintained in a public repository or do NOT have a stable identifier, such as a DOI.

-- There are no author-created data artifacts.



\paragraph{Proprietary Artifacts:}  (One of these options remains.)

--- None of the associated artifacts, author-created or otherwise, are proprietary.

-- No author-created artifacts are proprietary. There are associated proprietary artifacts that are not created by the authors.

-- Some author-created artifacts are proprietary.
